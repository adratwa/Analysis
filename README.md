# "Identifying Key Factors for Boosting Sales in a Luxury E-Commerce Website: A Data-Driven Analysis"


## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to determine which attributes of a luxury e-commerce website influence customers' decisions to buy particular products in order to increase its online sales. The project involves data analysis, data preparation, and modeling.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is provided by the company and contains information on each customer session (type of device, movement in the website, duration, origin, etc.). The data is stored in a CSV file and contains both numerical and categorical variables.

## Requirements

The project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/adratwa/Luxury_Company_Project.git
```

Then install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook using:

```
jupyter notebook Project_final.ipynb
```

The notebook contains detailed explanations of the data analysis, preparation, and modeling steps. You can follow along and run the code cells to reproduce the results.

## Results

The results of the project are presented in the Jupyter notebook. The models used in the project are evaluated using cross-validation and accuracy scores are reported. The best performing model is used to make predictions on the test data.

## Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed the dataset provided by the luxury e-commerce company and determined the attributes that influence customers' decisions to buy particular products. We also prepared the data and built several models to predict customer purchases. The best performing model was used to make predictions on the test data. The results show that the models can predict customer purchases with a high degree of accuracy, which can help the company increase its online sales.
